## 4.4

### Generic
- [ ] Port to libmodule 6.0.0 (?)
- [ ] Add a Dump dbus method (and a DUMP_REQ request) to allow any module to dump their state (module_dump()) to a txt file

### BACKLIGHT multiple-monitors curves
- [ ] Add support for config files to give each monitor its own backlight curves. Something like /etc/clight/clight.conf + /etc/clight/mon.d/$MONITOR_SERIAL.conf (where MONITOR_SERIAL can be found through org.clightd.clightd.Backlight.GetAll)
- [ ] If any conf file is found in /etc/clight/mon.d/, avoid calling SetAll, and just call Set on each serial.

### Bus
- [ ] Expose BUS_REQ to make dbus call from custom modules -> 
CALL: sd_bus_message_appendv(m, signature, args) + sd_bus_message_readv(m, signature, args);
SET_PROP: sd_bus_set_propertyv
GET_PROP; sd_bus_get_property() + sd_bus_message_readv()
typedef struct {
    enum bus_call_type type;
    va_list write_args;
    va_list read_args;
} bus_req;
